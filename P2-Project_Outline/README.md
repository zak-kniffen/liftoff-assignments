## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  My app idea is a speech therapy app for toddlers that allows someone to test their toddler with different phonetic speech examples and keep track of their progress over time on each of the different speech sounds, as well as their speech progress as a whole.
### Features

  Flash Cards or radio button form:  User will be able to select yes/no for each word to show whether their child pronounced it correctly.
  Submission Weighting:  A system that weights the results so that the child has less of the ones that they got right and more of those they got wrong
